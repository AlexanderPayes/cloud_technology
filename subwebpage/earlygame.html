        <ol>
           <li>After you get tools armor and ahouse, look for a village. Once you found one trap the villagers into a enclosed area.</li>
        <li>After you have a "townhall" trade with your villagers to get resources like enchanting books for the end game.</li>
        <li>You coud trade for diamonds to get better armor and tools.</li>
        <img src="images/trading.jpg" alt="">
        <ul>---If you choose not to start a townhall go mining for diamonds---</ul>
        <li>Once you obtained diamonds make a diamond pickaxe or diamond armor and mine obsidian which is made from mixing water and lava.</li>
        <img src="images/better diamond.png" alt="">
        <li>One you have 14 obsdian make a nether portal wand light it up with a flint and steel</li>
