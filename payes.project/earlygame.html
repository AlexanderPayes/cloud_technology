    <li> First you wold have to get basic resources, like wood and stone.</li>
    <li>After you have basic tools find a proper cave which where you would get iron to get better materials.</li>
    <li class="text">Than once you have enough iron, make iron tools armor etc.</li>
    <img  src="images/tools and armor.jpg" alt="">
    <li>One you have your basic gear start to travel and explore the world for a base location.</li>
    <li> After you have the right amount of materials build a small base which will serve as a base of operations.</li>

           <li>After you get tools armor and ahouse, look for a village. Once you found one trap the villagers into a enclosed area.</li>
        <li>After you have a "townhall" trade with your villagers to get resources like enchanting books for the end game.</li>
        <li>You coud trade for diamonds to get better armor and tools.</li>
        <img src="images/trading.jpg" alt="">
        <ul>---If you choose not to start a townhall go mining for diamonds---</ul>
        <li>Once you obtained diamonds make a diamond pickaxe or diamond armor and mine obsidian which is made from mixing water and lava.</li>
        <img src="images/better diamond.png" alt="">
        <li>One you have 14 obsdian make a nether portal wand light it up with a flint and steel</li>

        <li>Travel to the nether and eventually you would end up at a nehter fortress. Find a blaze spawner and kill blazes for their powder.</li>
